# Charter Rewards App

Charter Rewards app is a sample app to perform calculation for Rewards points earned by user for the past 3 month period.

I have used [Github Sales Data](https://github.com/sprabhakaran/csvfiles/blob/master/SalesData.csv) for getting the sample transaction data.

A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.

A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.

(e.g., a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
